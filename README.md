## Customizable Elements and their Positioning

Welcome to my frontend web development project! This project allows you to create a customizable website with features like a navbar, footer, pricing products, and the ability to position these elements as you desire. I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this project.

### Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

- *index.html*: This is the main HTML file for your website. You can customize the content and layout of your website here.

- *HTML Components*: This folder includes all the other pages for the website, including NavBar, pricing, footer, cards etc which can be customised from the website.

- *JAVASCRIPT Components*: JavaScript is used here to handle interactions, such as making the navbar responsive and dynamically updating pricing product details.

- *images folder*: You can store images for your website in this folder.

### Customizable Navbar

To customize the navbar, you can directly run the index.html file, then navigate to navbarPage, there you can customise the values and redirecting links of the Navbar.

### Footer

The footer of your website is also customizable. You can adjust its content similarly as navBar and similarly other components can also be customised.

### Element Positioning

You have full control over the positioning of elements in your project. To position the navbar, footer, and pricing products. 

### How to Run

To run this website, you can open CLI and type `git clone https://github.com/Rishbahjain2612/WebSite_Builder_TailwindCSS` and press enter.

After that, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
